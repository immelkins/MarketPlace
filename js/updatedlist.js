            "Heart of Darkness (1899) is a novella by Polish-English novelist Joseph Conrad, about a voyage up the Congo River into the Congo Free State, in the heart of Africa, by the story's narrator Charles Marlow. Marlow tells his story to friends aboard a boat anchored on the River Thames. Joseph Conrad is one of the greatest English writers, and Heart of Darkness is considered his best.  His readers are brought to face our psychological selves to answer, \u2018Who is the true savage?\u2019. Originally published in 1902, Heart of Darkness remains one of this century\u2019s most enduring works of fiction. Written several years after Joseph Conrad\u2019s grueling sojourn in the Belgian Congo, the novel is a complex meditation on colonialism, evil, and the thin line between civilization and barbarity.",

This autobiographical account chronicles the remarkable odyssey of Harriet Jacobs (1813\u20131897) whose dauntless spirit and faith carried her from a life of servitude and degradation in North Carolina to liberty and reunion with her children in the North.\r\nWritten and published in 1861 after Jacobs' harrowing escape from a vile and predatory master, the memoir delivers a powerful and unflinching portrayal of the abuses and hypocrisy of the master-slave relationship. Jacobs writes frankly of the horrors she suffered as a slave, her eventual escape after several unsuccessful attempts, and her seven years in self-imposed exile, hiding in a coffin-like \"garret\" attached to her grandmother's porch.\r\nA rare firsthand account of a courageous woman's determination and endurance, this inspirational story also represents a valuable historical record of the continuing battle for freedom and the preservation of family.",

Dotada de un estilo literario que supuso una renovaci\u00f3n en la prosa de la \u00e9poca, *Nada* refleja tambi\u00e9n la lenta desaparici\u00f3n de la peque\u00f1a burgues\u00eda tras la Guerra Civil.\r\n\r\nLa protagonista de la novela es una joven hu\u00e9rfana de padres, llamada Andrea, que reci\u00e9n terminada la Guerra Civil Espa\u00f1ola se traslada a la ciudad de Barcelona para estudiar y empezar una nueva vida.

As experience overtakes innocence, Andrea gradually learns the disquieting truth about the people she shares her life with: her overbearing and superstitious aunt Angustias; her nihilistic yet artistically gifted uncle Roman and his violent brother Juan; and Juan\'s disturbingly beautiful wife, Gloria, who secretly supports the clan with her gambling. From existential crisis to a growing maturity and resolve, Andrea\'s passionate inner journey leaves her wiser, stronger, and filled with hope for the future."--BOOK JACKET',

            "When Mr. Dashwood dies, he must leave the bulk of his estate to the son by his first marriage, which leaves his second wife and three daughters (Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret) in straitened circumstances. They are taken in by a kindly cousin, but their lack of fortune affects the marriageability of both practical Elinor and romantic Marianne. When Elinor forms an attachment for the wealthy Edward Ferrars, his family disapproves and separates them. And though Mrs. Jennings tries to match the worthy (and rich) Colonel Brandon to her, Marianne finds the dashing and fiery Willoughby more to her taste. Both relationships are sorely tried. But this is a romance, and through the hardships and heartbreak, true love and a happy ending will find their way for both the sister who is all sense and the one who is all sensibility. - Publisher.",

The tales (mostly in verse, although some are in prose) are told as part of a story-telling contest by a group of pilgrims as they travel together on a journey from Southwark to the shrine of Saint Thomas Becket at Canterbury Cathedral. In a long list of works, including Troilus and Criseyde, House of Fame, and Parliament of Fowls, The Canterbury Tales was Chaucer's magnum opus. He uses the tales and the descriptions of the characters to paint an ironic and critical portrait of English society at the time, and particularly of the Church. Structurally, the collection bears the influence of The Decameron, which Chaucer is said to have come across during his first diplomatic mission to Italy in 1372. However, Chaucer peoples his tales with 'sondry folk' rather than Boccaccio's fleeing nobles.",

            "A parody of traveler\u2019s tales and a satire of human nature, \u201cGulliver\u2019s Travels\u201d is Jonathan Swift\u2019s most famous work which was first published in 1726. An immensely popular tale ever since its original publication, \u201cGulliver\u2019s Travels\u201d is the story of its titular character, Lemuel Gulliver, a man who loves to travel. A series of four journeys are detailed in which Gulliver finds himself in a number of amusing and precarious situations. In the first voyage, Gulliver is imprisoned by a race of tiny people, the Lilliputians, when following a shipwreck he is washed upon the shores of their island country. In his second voyage Gulliver finds himself abandoned in Brobdingnag, a land of giants, where he is exhibited for their amusement. In his third voyage, Gulliver once again finds himself marooned; fortunately he is rescued by the flying island of Laputa, a kingdom devoted to the arts of music and mathematics. He subsequently travels to the surrounding lands of Balnibarbi, Luggnagg, Glubbdubdrib, and Japan. Finally in his last voyage, when he is set adrift by a mutinous crew, he finds himself in the curious Country of the Houyhnhnms. Through the various experiences of Gulliver, Swift brilliantly satirizes the political and cultural environment of his time in addition to creating a lasting and enchanting tale of fantasy. This edition is illustrated by Milo Winter and includes an introduction by George R. Dennis.",

            "**The Rebel** (French: *L'Homme r\u00e9volt\u00e9*) is a 1951 book-length essay by Albert Camus, which treats both the metaphysical and the historical development of rebellion and revolution in societies, especially Western Europe.\r\n\r\nExamining both rebellion and revolt, which may be seen as the same phenomenon in personal and social frames, Camus examines several' countercultural' figures and movements from the history of Western thought and art, noting the importance of each in the overall development of revolutionary thought and philosophy. He analyses the decreasing social importance of the king, god and of virtue and the development of nihilism. It can be seen as a sequel to The Myth of Sisyphus, where he ponders the meaning of life, because it answers the same question, but offers an alternative solution.\r\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

          description: [
            "*Edith Wharton wrote Ethan Frome as a frame story \u2014 meaning that the prologue and epilogue constitute a \"frame\" around the main story*\r\n\r\n**How It All Goes Down**\r\nIt's winter. A nameless engineer is in Starkfield, Massachusetts on business and he first sees Ethan Frome at the post office. Ethan is a man in his early fifties who is obviously strong, and obviously crippled. The man becomes fascinated with Ethan and wants to know his story. When Ethan begins giving him occasional rides to the train station, the two men strike up a friendship. One night when the weather is particularly bad, Ethan invites the man to stay at his house. In the hall the man hears a woman talking angrily, on and on. When Ethan speaks, the voice stops. The man tells us that he learned something that night which allowed him to imagine Ethan's story. Now we go back in time 24 years and learn about Ethan's life.\r\n\r\nEthan has walked from his farm and sawmill into town to pick up Mattie Silver from the church dance. He peeks in the windows of the church basement and sees Mattie dancing with Denis Eady and is jealous. Mattie is Ethan's wife's cousin. Her parents both died just over a year ago, and she was left with nothing. Her father had apparently swindled some of the relatives out of their savings, so nobody wanted to help Mattie. Zeena, Ethan's wife, is always sick, and decided to let Mattie live with them in exchange for doing the housework and helping the ailing Zeena.\r\n\r\nEthan liked Mattie from the beginning and worried that Zeena was too hard on her. The two women soon adjusted to each other (sort of) and things weren't as bad as they could have been. Meanwhile, Ethan has fallen in love with Mattie and wants to spend all his time with her.\r\n\r\nMattie soon comes out of the dance, and Ethan watches while Denis Eady tries to give her a ride home. She brushes him off and then Ethan reveals his presence. Ethan and Mattie are happy to see each other. They discuss possibly doing some sledding in the future. Neither is afraid to sled down the hill \u2013 at the bottom of which lies the deadly elm tree. The walk home is altogether lovely and romantic, but when they arrive, the house key isn't under the mat like it usually is.\r\n\r\nSoon, Zeena, looking ill and scary, comes downstairs and lets them in. She's usually in bed by this hour but she couldn't sleep. She is obviously suspicious of their behavior. The next day she announces that she will be gone overnight visiting a new doctor. Mattie and Ethan make good use of her absence and enjoy a romantic dinner for two. Unfortunately, the cat breaks Zeena's favorite dish and Ethan isn't able to locate any glue until after Zeena gets back. The first thing Zeena does when she gets home is to tell Ethan that she's kicking out Mattie. He protests, but fighting is useless. Then Zeena finds the broken pickle dish and is super upset (it had been a wedding gift).\r\n\r\nEthan decides he'll run away with Mattie, but then a combination of lack of cash and guilt stop him. Still, he insists on driving Mattie to the train station. He takes her on the long route, so they can look at different places they enjoyed together. By the time they get to the town sledding hill, it's already dark. As they are contemplating sledding, and pondering the hopelessness of their situation, Mattie suggests that they sled into the elm tree and kill themselves. Ethan agrees and they smash into the tree. But they survive.\r\n\r\nThen the story goes back to the present and we find the engineer right where we left him, about to enter the Frome kitchen. When he does enter he learns that the woman who was talking on and on in an argumentative tone is\u2026Mattie! She has spinal disease and can't move without assistance. Zeena is there too, cooking. They all three live together, an unhappy family in the Frome house.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\nAlso contained in: \r\n\r\n - [Age of Innocence / The House of Mirth / Ethan Frome](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL20577050W)\r\n - [Edith Wharton Reader](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL98540W/The_Edith_Wharton_reader)\r\n - [Ethan Frome and Other Stories](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL15000117W/Ethan_Frome_and_other_stories)\r\n - [Ethan Frome and Related Readings][1]\r\n - [Ethan Frome and Selected Stories](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL15000119W/Ethan_Frome_and_Selected_Stories)\r\n - [Edith Wharton Omnibus](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL98499W/The_Edith_Wharton_Omnibus)\r\n - [Ethan Frome with Connections](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL15000126W/Ethan_Frome_with_Connections)\r\n - [The Hermit and the Wild Woman and other stories / Ethan Frome](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL13131348W/Ethan_Frome_The_Hermit_and_the_Wild_Woman_and_other_stories)\r\n - [Novellas and Other Writings](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL15000211W/Novellas_and_other_writings)\r\n - [Three Classics by American Women][2]\r\n - [Three Novels](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL15000264W/Three_Novels)\r\n - [Works of Edith Wharton](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL98524W/Works_of_Edith_Wharton)\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://openlibrary.org/works/OL16061406W/Ethan_Frome_and_Related_Readings\r\n  [2]: https://openlibrary.org/works/OL15514881W/Three_Classics_by_American_Women_(The_Awakening_Ethan_Frome_O_Pioneers!",

            'This #1 selling non-majors microbiology textbook is praised for its straightforward presentation of complex topics, careful balance of concepts and applications, and proven art that teaches. In its Tenth Edition, Tortora/Funke/Case responds to the #1 challenge of the microbiology course: teaching a wide range of student levels, while still addressing student under-preparedness. The Tenth Edition meets students at their respective skill levels. First, the book signals core microbiology content to students with the new and highly visual Foundation Figures that students need to understand before moving forward in a chapter. Second, the book gives students frequent opportunities for self-assessment with the new Check Your Understanding questions that correspond by number to the chapter Learning Objectives. Then, a new "visual learning" orientation includes: an increased number of the popular Diseases in Focus boxes, newly illustrated end-of-chapter Study Outlines that provide students with visual cues to remind them of chapter content, and new end-of-chapter Draw It questions. The all-new art program is contemporary without compromising Tortora/Funke/Case\'s hallmark reputation for precision and clarity. Content revisions include substantially revised immunity chapters and an increased emphasis on antimicrobial resistance, bioterrorism, and biofilms. The new Get Ready for Microbiology workbook and online practice and assessment materials help students prepare for the course.',

            'Metamorphosis (German: Die Verwandlung) is a novella written by Franz Kafka which was first published in 1915. One of Kafka\'s best-known works, Metamorphosis tells the story of salesman Gregor Samsa, who wakes one morning to find himself inexplicably transformed into a huge insect (German: ungeheueres Ungeziefer, lit. "monstrous vermin") and subsequently struggles to adjust to this new condition. The novella has been widely discussed among literary critics, with differing interpretations being offered. In popular culture and adaptations of the novella, the insect is commonly depicted as a cockroach.\r\n\r\nWith a length of about 70 printed pages over three chapters, it is the longest of the stories Kafka considered complete and published during his lifetime. The text was first published in 1915 in the October issue of the journal Die wei\u00dfen Bl\u00e4tter under the editorship of Ren\u00e9 Schickele. The first edition in book form appeared in December 1915 in the series Der j\u00fcngste Tag, edited by Kurt Wolff.',

And when a pack of wolves begins to accept her into their community, Miyax must learn to think like a wolf as well. If she trusts her Eskimo instincts, will she stand a chance of surviving?",

It is the sequel to *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* (1865). Although it makes no reference to the events in the earlier book, the themes and settings of *Through the Looking-Glass* make it a kind of mirror image of Wonderland: the first book begins outdoors, in the warm month of May, uses frequent changes in size as a plot device, and draws on the imagery of playing cards; the second opens indoors on a snowy, wintry night exactly six months later, on November 4 (the day before Guy Fawkes Night), uses frequent changes in time and spatial directions as a plot device, and draws on the imagery of chess. In it, there are many mirror themes, including opposites, time running backwards, and so on. ([Wikipedia][1])\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through_the_Looking-Glass",

A gripping, heart-wrenching, and wholly remarkable tale of coming-of-age in a South poisoned by virulent prejudice, it views a world of great beauty and savage inequities through the eyes of a young girl, as her father -- a crusading local lawyer -- risks everything to defend a black man unjustly accused of a terrible crime.\r\n\r\nLawyer Atticus Finch defends Tom Robinson -- a black man charged with the rape of a white girl. Writing through the young eyes of Finch's children Scout and Jem, Harper Lee explores with rich humor and unswerving honesty the irrationality of adult attitudes toward race and class in small-town Alabama during the mid-1930s Depression years. The conscience of a town steeped in prejudice, violence, and hypocrisy is pricked by the stamina and quiet heroism of one man's struggle for justice. But the weight of history will only tolerate so much.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\nAlso contained in:\r\n\r\n - [Best Sellers from Reader's Digest Condensed Books](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL16035425W)",

            "Fathers and Sons takes the conflict between generations as its subject. The novel's central characters, Yevgeny Bazarov and his disciple and fellow student, Arkady Kirsanov, are self-proclaimed Nihilists: repudiators of all the received truths of art, religion, and politics-all claims to truth, in fact, except those verifiable by scientific experiment. Turgenev thrusts his snarling young radicals into the venerable world of fathers when Bazarov accompanies Arkady to the Kirsanov country estate. The visit inevitably turns sour, and Arkady's Uncle Pavel and Bazarov find themselves at one another's metaphysical throats. Their disagreements escalate into a dangerous confrontation.When Fathers and Sons was published in 1862, it enveloped its author in a storm of controversy. Those on the political right saw it as a dangerous glorification of nihilism, whereas those on the political left believed it to be a vicious caricature of the progressives of the younger generation. Today, the novel continues to engage us with its vital characters and subtle handling of universal themes.",

            "Things Fall Apart is the debut novel by Nigerian author Chinua Achebe, first published in 1958. It depicts pre-colonial life in the southeastern part of Nigeria and the arrival of Europeans during the late 19th century. It is seen as the archetypal modern African novel in English, and one of the first to receive global critical acclaim. It is a staple book in schools throughout Africa and is widely read and studied in English-speaking countries around the world. The novel was first published in the UK in 1962 by William Heinemann Ltd, and became the first work published in Heinemann's African Writers Series.\r\n\r\nThe novel follows the life of Okonkwo, an Igbo (\"Ibo\" in the novel) man and local wrestling champion in the fictional Nigerian clan of Umuofia. The work is split into three parts, with the first describing his family, personal history, and the customs and society of the Igbo, and the second and third sections introducing the influence of European colonialism and Christian missionaries on Okonkwo, his family, and the wider Igbo community.\r\n\r\nThings Fall Apart was followed by a sequel, No Longer at Ease (1960), originally written as the second part of a larger work along with Arrow of God (1964). Achebe states that his two later novels A Man of the People (1966) and Anthills of the Savannah (1987), while not featuring Okonkwo's descendants, are spiritual successors to the previous novels in chronicling African history.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\nContained in:\r\n[African Trilogy](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL891766W)",

            "James Joyce's disillusion with the publication of Dubliners in 1914 was the result of ten years battling with publishers, resisting their demands to remove swear words, real place names and much else, including two entire stories. Although only 24 when he signed his first publishing contract for the book, Joyce already knew its worth: to alter it in any way would 'retard the course of civilisation in Ireland'. Joyce's aim was to tell the truth -- to create a work of art that would reflect life in Ireland at the turn of the last century. By rejecting euphemism, he would reveal to the Irish the unromantic reality, the recognition of which would lead to the spiritual liberation of the country. Each of the fifteen stories offers a glimpse of the lives of ordinary Dubliners -- a death, an encounter, an opportunity not taken, a memory rekindled -- and collectively they paint a portrait of a nation. - Back cover.\r\n\r\nDubliners is a collection of vignettes of Dublin life at the end of the 19th Century written, by Joyce\u2019s own admission, in a manner that captures some of the unhappiest moments of life. Some of the dominant themes include lost innocence, missed opportunities and an inability to escape one\u2019s circumstances.\r\n\r\nJoyce\u2019s intention in writing Dubliners, in his own words, was to write a chapter of the moral history of his country, and he chose Dublin for the scene because that city seemed to him to be the centre of paralysis. He tried to present the stories under four different aspects: childhood, adolescence, maturity and public life.\r\n\u2018The Sisters\u2019, \u2018An Encounter\u2019 and \u2018Araby\u2019 are stories from childhood. \u2018Eveline\u2019, \u2018After the Race\u2019, \u2018Two Gallants\u2019 and \u2018The Boarding House\u2019 are stories from adolescence. \u2018A Little Cloud\u2019, \u2018Counterparts\u2019, \u2018Clay\u2019 and \u2018A Painful Case\u2019 are all stories concerned with mature life. Stories from public life are \u2018Ivy Day in the Committee Room\u2019 and \u2018A Mother and Grace\u2019. \u2018The Dead\u2019 is the last story in the collection and probably Joyce\u2019s greatest. It stands alone and, as the title would indicate, is concerned with death.\r\n\r\n----------\r\nContains\r\n\r\n[Sisters](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL15073389W/The_Sisters)\r\n[Encounter](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL15073256W)\r\n[Araby](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL20570121W)\r\n[Eveline](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL15073302W)\r\n[After the Race](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL18179262W)\r\n[Two Gallants](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL20570300W)\r\n[Boarding House](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL15073259W/The_Boarding_House)\r\n[Little Cloud](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL18179222W)\r\n[Counterparts](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL20570464W)\r\n[Clay](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL18179205W)\r\n[A Painful Case](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL5213767W)\r\n[Ivy Day In the Committee Room](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL20571820W)\r\n[Mother](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL18179244W)\r\n[Grace](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL15073323W)\r\n[Dead](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL15073437W/The_Dead)\r\n\r\n----------\r\nAlso contained in:\r\n\r\n - [Dubliners / Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL15073371W/Dubliners_Portrait_of_the_Artist_as_a_Young_Man)\r\n - [Essential James Joyce](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL86338W/The_Essential_James_Joyce)\r\n - [Portable James Joyce](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL86334W/The_Portable_James_Joyce)",

What started out as a survey of the twelve leading American history textbooks has ended up being what the San Francisco Chronicle calls "an extremely convincing plea for truth in education." In Lies My Teacher Told Me, James W. Loewen brings history alive in all its complexity and ambiguity. Beginning with pre-Columbian history and ranging over characters and events as diverse as Reconstruction, Helen Keller, the first Thanksgiving, and the Mai Lai massacre, Loewen offers an eye-opening critique of existing textbooks, and a wonderful retelling of American history as it should -- and could -- be taught to American students. - Publisher.',

As with previous editions, Molecular Biology of the Cell, Sixth Edition accomplishes this goal with clear writing and beautiful illustrations. The Sixth Edition has been extensively revised and updated with the latest research in the field of cell biology, and it provides an exceptional framework for teaching and learning. The entire illustration program has been greatly enhanced. Protein structures better illustrate structure-function relationships, icons are simpler and more consistent within and between chapters, and micrographs have been refreshed and updated with newer, clearer, or better images. As a new feature, each chapter now contains intriguing open-ended questions highlighting "What We Don\'t Know," introducing students to challenging areas of future research. Updated end-of-chapter problems reflect new research discussed in the text. Thought-provoking end-of-chapter questions have been expanded to all chapters, including questions on developmental biology, tissues and stem cells, the immune system, and pathogens"--Provided by publisher.',

Feeling compelled to respect the knowledge and power of the white man, Ezeulu sends one of his young sons to learn Christianity so that he will know the secret of such strength. But this brings the conflict between old ways and new to a head as the boy, in an excess of freshly-inspired Christian enthusiasm, tries to kill a royal python, a creature most sacred in the religious traditions of Umuaro. After this, Ezeulu's opposition to the authority of the white man becomes more pronounced, but his noble obstinacy, although it achieves a temporary victory over Captain Winterbottom, brings tragedy in the end. This moving story captures the atmosphere of African village life, the beautiful proverb-laden language of the Igbo and their strangely formal customs of worship and hospitality.--From publisher description.",

But the cosy world the two construct is shattered when Ambrose sets off on a trip to Florence. There he falls in love and marries - and there he dies suddenly. In almost no time at all, the new widow - Philip's cousin Rachel - turns up in England. Despite himself, Philip is drawn to this beautiful, sophisticated, mysterious woman like a moth to the flame.

It explains the structure and function of a broad sampling of organisms in enough detail so that students can develop a working vocabulary about life's parts and processes. - Page xvii. Throughout this book, you will come across many examples of how organisms are constructed, how they function, where they live, what they do.

The eminent literary critic Lewis Gannett wrote, \" We have had many novels from statesmen and reformers, almost all bad; many novels from poets, almost all thin. In Alan Paton's Cry, the Beloved Country the statesman, the poet and the novelist meet in a unique harmony.\"\r\n\r\nCry, the Beloved Country is the deeply moving story of the Zulu pastor Stephen Kumalo and his son, Absalom, set against the background of a land and a people riven by racial injustice. Remarkable for its lyricism, unforgettable for character and incident, Cry, the Beloved Country is a classic work of love and hope, courage and endurance, born of the dignity of man. - Jacket flap.",

Apart from its intrinsic interest the Christian account of social and political relations which Augustine gives was to furnish one of the most fertile sources of material for the controversial literature of the middle ages. R. W.\n\nDyson has produced a complete, accurate, authoritative and fluent translation of The City of God, edited together with full biographical notes, a concise introduction, bibliographical note and chronology of Augustine's life.",

Plotnik has revised and updated his text page by page to increase the depth of coverage in key areas - without losing the student focus that made the book work so effectively in its previous edition. Each chapter\'s opening vignette serves to organize and tie information together as Plotnik moves through major concepts. Each of the module\'s key topics is covered ina one-, two-, or (very occassionally) four-page spread. By presenting information in these "bite-sized" chunks with fully integrated visuals, Plotnik makes the material more accessible to students and easier to recall.',

Lloyd Kramer joins the author team for this ninth edition that includes two new color inserts highlighting fine art, additional pedagogy to guide students through challenging material, and full, up-to-date inclusion of current events.\r\nFirst published in 1950, translated into six languages, is used in more than 1,000 colleges and universities as well as many high school advanced placement courses. The second edition (1956), comprises two volumes, 20 main chapters and 110 sub-chapters.

It is written to impart a sense of intellectual history of biochemistry, an understanding of the tools and approaches used to solve biochemical puzzles, and a hint of the excitement that accompanies new discoveries. This edition has been thoroughly updated to reflect the most recent advances in biochemistry, particularly in the areas of genomics and structural biology. A new chapter focuses on cytoskeletal and motor proteins, currently one of the most active areas of research in biochemistry.",

Professor Goldstein's presentation of alternative theories, including feminism and postmodernism early in the text helps students approach international relations by utilizing a variety of viewpoints. International Relations also shows how a new North-South gap has replaced the old East-West cleavage of the Cold War.\n\nIn examining the influences on international relations, the author goes beyond the three customary levels of analysis (individual, domestic, and state) and adds a fourth global dimension to study the importance of the United Nations, the environment, global communication, and culture in world affairs. This second edition has been thoroughly updated to include the conflict in Bosnia, the development of peace in the Middle East, and economic integration in Europe.\n\nThis new edition also offers color maps of the world's major regions for the reader's convenience.",

Strobel challenges them with questions like How reliable is the New Testament? Does evidence exist for Jesus outside the Bible? Is there any reason to believe the resurrection was an actual event? Strobel's tough, point-blank questions make this remarkable book read like a captivating, fast-paced novel. But it's not fiction. It's a riveting quest for the truth about history's most compelling figure. What will your verdict be in The Case for Christ?",

Nos satisface si porque este libro est\u00e1 concebido con ese objetivo, como lo asentamos en el aparte correspondiente a la Gu\u00eda Did\u00e1ctica.\r\nEl libro viene a llenar un vac\u00edo, gracias a que cumple con la programaci\u00f3n vigente desde este a\u00f1o, en t\u00f3picos que estaban haciendo falta: los de Historia de Am\u00e9rica hasta la actualidad y los correspondientes a los acontecimientos mundiales que son el tema diario. En la presentaci\u00f3n de ese nuevo material mantenemos la misma seriedad que hemos tenido a lo largo de todo el libro: tratamiento amplio de la tem\u00e1tica y material de apoyo tanto para la fijaci\u00f3n como para la ampliaci\u00f3n.\r\nEl Autor",

            "The works of Kenyan author Ngugi have made a powerful impact throughout the world. A Grain of Wheat was recognised as one of Africa's 100 best books of the twentieth century in an initiative organised by the Zimbabwe International Book Fair. The central action in this novel by Ngugi wa Thiong'o takes place in December of 1963 in a village in Kenya that is preparing for the coming of Uhuru (Independence). However, the plot is non-linear, with a wealth of flashbacks and various twists and turns. There are also multiple storylines which are well-woven into a fascinating tapestry. The main story is indeed the coming of Independence Day, part of which involves identifying the person who betrayed Kihika, one of the leading freedom fighters from the village. Many of the flashbacks along this storyline involve the fight for freedom as well as details about what occurred in the detention camps. Another prominent storyline is that involving a love triangle between Mumbi and her two suitors, Gikonyo and Karanja. A third intriguing storyline involves Mugo, a man whom everyone recognizes as different yet feels drawn to. Ngugi portrays his inner conflict masterfully, especially in using biblical allusions to both Moses and Judas in relation to Mugo.\"--Www.mouthshut.com (Oct. 22, 2010).",
